# PhD

This code is part of the code I used for my PhD project to calculate how hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons discriminate memory. There is code that discriminates between cell types, calculates spatial map correlations and remapping. There is also code to investigate how temporal correlations and not spatial remapping signal memory discrimination. I am in the process of uploading the files.
